Some ground rules
---------------------

- Self contained module
  - everything to do with my module is in my module
  - no global variables
  - if a module manages more than one thing it should be spilt up
- Seperation of concerns
- DRY code: Dont repeat yourself
- Efficient DOM usage
  - very few $(selections)
- No memory leaks
  - all events can be unbound
